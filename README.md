## Credits

Coursework for the bootcamp was used as reference material in completing this project.

Documentation for [React](https://react.dev/) was incredibly helpful.

I also relied on documentation for [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/).

Filler text courtesy of [hipster ipsum](https://hipsum.co/?paras=5&type=hipster-centric).

I followed [this tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-download-pdf-file-in-reactjs/) by geeksforgeeks for help with adding the file download for the Resume page.

No starter code was provided for this project.
